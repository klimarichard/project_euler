## Problems 76 - 100
### 76 - Counting summations
It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:\
\
`4 + 1`\
`3 + 2`\
`3 + 1 + 1`\
`2 + 2 + 1`\
`2 + 1 + 1 + 1`\
`1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`\
\
How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive
integers?

### 77 - Prime summations
It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:\
\
`7 + 3`\
`5 + 5`\
`5 + 3 + 2`\
`3 + 3 + 2 + 2`\
`2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2`\
\
What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five
thousand different ways?

### 78 - Coin partitions
Let `p(n)` represent the number of different ways in which `n` coins can be
separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into piles in
exactly seven different ways, so `p(5)=7`.\
\
OOOOO\
OOOO&nbsp;&nbsp;O\
OOO&nbsp;&nbsp;OO\
OOO&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;O\
OO&nbsp;&nbsp;OO&nbsp;&nbsp;O\
OO&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;O\
O&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;O\
\
Find the least value of `n` for which `p(n)` is divisible by one million.

### 79 - Passcode derivation
A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three
random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was `531278`, they
may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: `317`.\
\
The text file, [p079_keylog.txt](../../res/p079_keylog.txt), contains fifty
successful login attempts.\
\
Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the file so
as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown length.

### 80 - Square root digital expansion
It is well known that if the square root of a natural number is not an integer,
then it is irrational. The decimal expansion of such square roots is infinite
without any repeating pattern at all.\
\
The square root of two is `1.41421356237309504880...`, and the digital sum of the
first one hundred decimal digits is `475`.\
\
For the first one hundred natural numbers, find the total of the digital sums of
the first one hundred decimal digits for all the irrational square roots.
