## Problems 76 - 100
### 76 - Counting summations
It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:\
\
`4 + 1`\
`3 + 2`\
`3 + 1 + 1`\
`2 + 2 + 1`\
`2 + 1 + 1 + 1`\
`1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`\
\
How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive
integers?

### 77 - Prime summations
It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:\
\
`7 + 3`\
`5 + 5`\
`5 + 3 + 2`\
`3 + 3 + 2 + 2`\
`2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2`\
\
What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five
thousand different ways?

### 78 - Coin partitions
Let `p(n)` represent the number of different ways in which `n` coins can be
separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into piles in
exactly seven different ways, so `p(5)=7`.\
