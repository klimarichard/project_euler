## Problems 26 - 50
### 26 - Reciprocal cycles
A unit fraction contains `1` in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit
fractions with denominators `2` to `10` are given:

<p>
<code>1/2  = 0.5</code><br>
<code>1/3  = 0.(3)</code><br>
<code>1/4  = 0.25</code><br>
<code>1/5  = 0.2</code><br>
<code>1/6  = 0.1(6)</code><br>
<code>1/7  = 0.(142857)</code><br>
<code>1/8  = 0.125</code><br>
<code>1/9  = 0.(1)</code><br>
<code>1/10 = 0.1</code><br>
</p>

Where `0.1(6)` means `0.166666...`, and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen
that `1/7` has a 6-digit recurring cycle.\
\
Find the value of `d < 1000` for which `1/d` contains the longest recurring cycle in
its decimal fraction part.

### 27 - Quadratic primes
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

<p align="center">
<code>n<sup>2</sup> + n + 41</code>.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer
values <code>0 <= n <= 39</code>. However, when <code>n = 40, 40<sup>2</sup> + 40 +
41 = 40(40 + 1) + 1</code> is divisible by <code>41</code>, and certainly when
<code>n = 41, 41<sup>2</sup> + 41 + 41</code> is clearly divisible by <code>41</code>.
</p>

<p>
The incredible formula <code>n<sup>2</sup> - 79n + 1601</code> was discovered, which
produces <code>80</code> primes for the consecutive values <code>0 <= n <= 79</code>.
The product of the coefficients, <code>-79</code> and <code>1601</code>, is
<code>-126479</code>.
</p>

Considering quadratics of the form:

<p>
<code>n<sup>2</sup> + an + b</code>, where <code>|a| < 1000</code> and 
<code>|b| <= 1000</code><br>
where <code>|n|</code> is the modulus/absolute value of <code>n</code>,<br>
e.g. <code>|11| = 11</code> and <code>|-4| = 4</code>.
</p>

Find the product of the coefficients, `a` and `b`, for the quadratic expression that
produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of `n`, starting with
`n = 0`.

### 28 - Number spiral diagonals
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a `5` by `5`
spiral is formed as follows:

<p align="center">
<code><b>21</b> 22 23 24 <b>25</b></code><br>
<code>20&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>7</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>9</b> 10</code><br>
<code>19&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;2 11</code><br>
<code>18&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>5</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3</b> 12</code><br>
<code><b>17</b> 16 15 14 <b>13</b></code><br>
</p>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is `101`.\
\
What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a `1001` by `1001` spiral formed
in the same way?

### 29 - Distinct powers
<p>
Consider all integer combinations of <code>a<sup>b</sup></code> for
<code>2 <= a <= 5</code> and <code>2 <= b <= 5</code>:
</p>

<p align="center">
<code>2<sup>2</sup> = 4</code>, <code>2<sup>3</sup> = 8</code>,
<code>2<sup>4</sup> = 16</code>, <code>2<sup>5</sup> = 32</code><br>
<code>3<sup>2</sup> = 9</code>, <code>3<sup>3</sup> = 27</code>,
<code>3<sup>4</sup> = 81</code>, <code>3<sup>5</sup> = 243</code><br>
<code>4<sup>2</sup> = 16</code>, <code>4<sup>3</sup> = 64</code>,
<code>4<sup>4</sup> = 256</code>, <code>4<sup>5</sup> = 1024</code><br>
<code>5<sup>2</sup> = 25</code>, <code>5<sup>3</sup> = 125</code>,
<code>5<sup>4</sup> = 625</code>, <code>5<sup>5</sup> = 3125</code>
</p>

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get
the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

<p align="center">
<code>4</code>, <code>8</code>, <code>9</code>, <code>16</code>, <code>25</code>,
<code>27</code>, <code>32</code>, <code>64</code>, <code>81</code>, <code>125</code>,
<code>243</code>, <code>256</code>, <code>625</code>, <code>1024</code>,
<code>3125</code>
</p>

<p>
How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by <code>a<sup>b</sup></code> for
<code>2 <= a <= 100</code> and <code>2 <= b <= 100</code>?
</p>

### 30 - Digit fifth powers
Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

<p align="center">
<code>1634 = 1<sup>4</sup> + 6<sup>4</sup> + 3<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup></code><br>
<code>8208 = 8<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 0<sup>4</sup> + 8<sup>4</sup></code><br>
<code>9474 = 9<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup> + 7<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup></code>
</p>

<p>
As <code>1 = 1<sup>4</sup></code> is not a sum it is not included.
</p>

The sum of these numbers is `1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316`.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

### 31 - Coin sums
In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are
eight coins in general circulation:

<p align="center">
<code>1p</code>, <code>2p</code>, <code>5p</code>, <code>10p</code>, <code>20p</code>,
<code>50p</code>, <code>£1 (100p)</code>, and <code>£2 (200p)</code>.
</p>

It is possible to make `£2` in the following way:

<p align="center">
<code>1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p</code>
</p>

How many different ways can `£2` be made using any number of coins?

### 32 - Pandigital products
We shall say that an `n`-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits
`1` to `n` exactly once; for example, the `5`-digit number, `15234`, is `1` through `5`
pandigital.\
\
The product `7254` is unusual, as the identity, `39 × 186 = 7254`, containing
multiplicand, multiplier, and product is `1` through `9` pandigital.\
\
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be
written as a `1` through `9` pandigital.\
**HINT**: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include
it once in your sum.

### 33 - Digit cancelling fractions
The fraction `49/98` is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in
attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that `49/98 = 4/8`, which is correct,
is obtained by cancelling the `9`s.\
\
We shall consider fractions like, `30/50 = 3/5`, to be trivial examples.\
\
There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in
value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.\
\
If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find
the value of the denominator.

### 34 - Digit factorials
`145` is a curious number, as `1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145`.\
\
Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.\
\
**Note:** As `1! = 1` and `2! = 2` are not sums they are not included.

### 35 - Circular primes
The number, `197`, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits:
`197`, `971`, and `719`, are themselves prime.\
\
There are thirteen such primes below `100`: `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11`, `13`, `17`, `31`,
`37`, `71`, `73`, `79`, and `97`.\
\
How many circular primes are there below one million?

### 36 - Double-base palindromes
<p>
The decimal number, <code>585 = 1001001001<sub>2</sub></code> (binary), is palindromic
in both bases.
</p>

Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base `10`
and base `2`.\
\
(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)

### 37 - Truncatable primes
The number `3797` has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible
to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage:
`3797`, `797`, `97`, and `7`. Similarly we can work from right to left:
`3797`, `379`, `37`, and `3`.\
\
Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right
and right to left.\
\
**NOTE:** `2`, `3`, `5`, and `7` are not considered to be truncatable primes.

### 38 - Pandigital multiples
Take the number `192` and multiply it by each of `1`, `2`, and `3`:

<p align="center">
<code>192 × 1 = 192</code><br>
<code>192 × 2 = 384</code><br>
<code>192 × 3 = 576</code>
</p>

By concatenating each product we get the `1` to `9` pandigital, `192384576`. We will
call `192384576` the concatenated product of `192` and `(1,2,3)`.\
\
The same can be achieved by starting with `9` and multiplying by `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`,
and `5`, giving the pandigital, `918273645`, which is the concatenated product of `9`
and `(1,2,3,4,5)`.

What is the largest `1` to `9` pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as
the concatenated product of an integer with `(1,2, ... , n)` where `n > 1`?

### 39 - Integer right triangles
If `p` is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
`{a,b,c}`, there are exactly three solutions for `p = 120`.

<p align="center">
<code>{20,48,52}</code>, <code>{24,45,51}</code>, <code>{30,40,50}</code>
</p>

For which value of `p ≤ 1000`, is the number of solutions maximised?

### 40 - Champernowne's constant
An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

<p align="center">
<code>0.12345678910<b>1</b>112131415161718192021...</code>
</p>

It can be seen that the 12<sup>th</sup> digit of the fractional part is `1`.

<p>
If <code>d<sub>n</sub></code> represents the n<sup>th</sup> digit of the fractional part,
find the value of the following expression:
</p>

<p align="center">
<code>d<sub>1</sub> × d<sub>10</sub> × d<sub>100</sub> × d<sub>1000</sub> ×
d<sub>10000</sub> × d<sub>100000</sub> × d<sub>1000000</sub></code>
</p>

### 41 - Pandigital prime
We shall say that an `n`-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits
`1` to `n` exactly once. For example, `2143` is a `4`-digit pandigital and is also prime.\
\
What is the largest `n`-digit pandigital prime that exists?

### 42 - Coded triangle numbers
<p>
The n<sup>th</sup> term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,
<code>t<sub>n</sub> = (1/2) * n(n+1)</code>; so the first ten triangle numbers are:
</p>

<p align="center">
<code>1</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>10</code>, <code>15</code>,
<code>21</code>, <code>28</code>, <code>36</code>, <code>45</code>, <code>55</code>, ...
</p>

<p>
By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical
position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value
for SKY is <code>19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t<sub>10</sub></code>. If the word value is
a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
</p>

Using [`p042_words.txt`](../../res/p042_words.txt), a 16K text file
containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle
words?

### 43 - Sub-string divisibility
The number, `1406357289`, is a `0` to `9` pandigital number because it is made up of
each of the digits `0` to `9` in some order, but it also has a rather interesting
sub-string divisibility property.

<p>
Let <code>d<sub>1</sub></code> be the 1st digit, <code>d<sub>2</sub></code> be the
2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:
</p>

<p align="center">
<code>d<sub>2</sub>d<sub>3</sub>d<sub>4</sub>=406</code> is divisible by
<code>2</code><br>
<code>d<sub>3</sub>d<sub>4</sub>d<sub>5</sub>=063</code> is divisible by
<code>3</code><br>
<code>d<sub>4</sub>d<sub>5</sub>d<sub>6</sub>=635</code> is divisible by
<code>5</code><br>
<code>d<sub>5</sub>d<sub>6</sub>d<sub>7</sub>=357</code> is divisible by
<code>7</code><br>
<code>d<sub>6</sub>d<sub>7</sub>d<sub>8</sub>=572</code> is divisible by
<code>11</code><br>
<code>d<sub>7</sub>d<sub>8</sub>d<sub>9</sub>=728</code> is divisible by
<code>13</code><br>
<code>d<sub>8</sub>d<sub>9</sub>d<sub>10</sub>=289</code> is divisible by
<code>17</code><br>
</p>

Find the sum of all `0` to `9` pandigital numbers with this property.

### 44 - Pentagon numbers
<p>
Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, <code>P<sub>n</sub>=n(3n−1)/2</code>.
The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
</p>

<p align="center">
<code>1</code>, <code>5</code>, <code>12</code>, <code>22</code>, <code>35</code>,
<code>51</code>, <code>70</code>, <code>92</code>, <code>117</code>, <code>145</code>,
...
</p>

<p>
It can be seen that <code>P<sub>4</sub> + P<sub>7</sub> = 22 + 70 = 92 =
P<sub>8</sub></code>. However, their difference, <code>70 − 22 = 48</code>, is not
pentagonal.
</p>

<p>
Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, <code>P<sub>j</sub></code> and
<code>P<sub>k</sub></code>, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and
<code>D = |P<sub>k</sub> − P<sub>j</sub>|</code> is minimised; what is the value of
<code>D</code>?
</p>

### 45 - Triangular, pentagonal and hexagonal
Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

<p align="center">
Triangle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<code>T<sub>n</sub>=n(n+1)/2</code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>1</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>6</code>,
<code>10</code>, <code>15</code>, ...<br>
Pentagonal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>P<sub>n</sub>=n(3n−1)/2</code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>1</code>, <code>5</code>, <code>12</code>,
<code>22</code>, <code>35</code>, ...<br>
Hexagonal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>H<sub>n</sub>=n(2n−1)</code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>1</code>, <code>6</code>,
<code>15</code>, <code>28</code>, <code>45</code>, ...
</p>

<p>
It can be verified that <code>T<sub>285</sub> = P<sub>165</sub> = H<sub>143</sub> =
40755</code>.
</p>

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

### 46 - Goldbach's other conjecture
It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written
as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

<p align="center">
<code>9 = 7 + 2×1<sup>2</sup></code><br>
<code>15 = 7 + 2×2<sup>2</sup></code><br>
<code>21 = 3 + 2×3<sup>2</sup></code><br>
<code>25 = 7 + 2×3<sup>2</sup></code><br>
<code>27 = 19 + 2×2<sup>2</sup></code><br>
<code>33 = 31 + 2×1<sup>2</sup></code>
</p>

It turns out that the conjecture was false.\
\
What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and
twice a square?

### 47 - Distinct prime factors
The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

<p align="center">
<code>14 = 2 × 7</code><br>
<code>15 = 3 × 5</code>
</p>

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

<p align="center">
<code>644 = 2<sup>2</sup> × 7 × 23</code><br>
<code>645 = 3 × 5 × 43</code><br>
<code>646 = 2 × 17 × 19</code>
</p>

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each.
What is the first of these numbers?

### 48 - Self powers
<p>
The series, <code>1<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> + ... +
10<sup>10</sup> = 10405071317</code>.
</p>

<p>
Find the last ten digits of the series, <code>1<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> +
3<sup>3</sup> + ... + 1000<sup>1000</sup></code>.
</p>

### 49 - Prime permutations
The arithmetic sequence, `1487`, `4817`, `8147`, in which each of the terms
increases by `3330`, is unusual in two ways:
- (i) each of the three terms are prime, and,
- (ii) each of the `4`-digit numbers are permutations of one another.\
\
There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three `1`-, `2`-, or `3`-digit primes,
exhibiting this property, but there is one other `4`-digit increasing sequence.\
\
What `12`-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?

### 50 - Consecutive prime sum
The prime `41`, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

<p align="center">
<code>41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13</code>
</p>

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.\
\
The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime,
contains 21 terms, and is equal to `953`.\
\
Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive
primes?
