## Problems 26 - 50
### 26 - Reciprocal cycles
A unit fraction contains `1` in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit
fractions with denominators `2` to `10` are given:

<p>
<code>1/2  = 0.5</code><br>
<code>1/3  = 0.(3)</code><br>
<code>1/4  = 0.25</code><br>
<code>1/5  = 0.2</code><br>
<code>1/6  = 0.1(6)</code><br>
<code>1/7  = 0.(142857)</code><br>
<code>1/8  = 0.125</code><br>
<code>1/9  = 0.(1)</code><br>
<code>1/10 = 0.1</code><br>
</p>

Where `0.1(6)` means `0.166666...`, and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen
that `1/7` has a 6-digit recurring cycle.\
\
Find the value of `d < 1000` for which `1/d` contains the longest recurring cycle in
its decimal fraction part.

### 27 - Quadratic primes
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

<p align="center">
<code>n<sup>2</sup> + n + 41</code>.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer
values <code>0 <= n <= 39</code>. However, when <code>n = 40, 40<sup>2</sup> + 40 +
41 = 40(40 + 1) + 1</code> is divisible by <code>41</code>, and certainly when
<code>n = 41, 41<sup>2</sup> + 41 + 41</code> is clearly divisible by <code>41</code>.
</p>

<p>
The incredible formula <code>n<sup>2</sup> - 79n + 1601</code> was discovered, which
produces <code>80</code> primes for the consecutive values <code>0 <= n <= 79</code>.
The product of the coefficients, <code>-79</code> and <code>1601</code>, is
<code>-126479</code>.
</p>

Considering quadratics of the form:

<p>
<code>n<sup>2</sup> + an + b</code>, where <code>|a| < 1000</code> and 
<code>|b| <= 1000</code><br>
where <code>|n|</code> is the modulus/absolute value of <code>n</code>,<br>
e.g. <code>|11| = 11</code> and <code>|-4| = 4</code>.
</p>

Find the product of the coefficients, `a` and `b`, for the quadratic expression that
produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of `n`, starting with
`n = 0`.

### 28 - Number spiral diagonals
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a `5` by `5`
spiral is formed as follows:

<p align="center">
<code><b>21</b> 22 23 24 <b>25</b></code><br>
<code>20&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>7</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>9</b> 10</code><br>
<code>19&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;2 11</code><br>
<code>18&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>5</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3</b> 12</code><br>
<code><b>17</b> 16 15 14 <b>13</b></code><br>
</p>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is `101`.\
\
What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a `1001` by `1001` spiral formed
in the same way?

### 29 - Distinct powers
<p>
Consider all integer combinations of <code>a<sup>b</sup></code> for
<code>2 <= a <= 5</code> and <code>2 <= b <= 5</code>:
</p>

<p align="center">
<code>2<sup>2</sup> = 4</code>, <code>2<sup>3</sup> = 8</code>,
<code>2<sup>4</sup> = 16</code>, <code>2<sup>5</sup> = 32</code><br>
<code>3<sup>2</sup> = 9</code>, <code>3<sup>3</sup> = 27</code>,
<code>3<sup>4</sup> = 81</code>, <code>3<sup>5</sup> = 243</code><br>
<code>4<sup>2</sup> = 16</code>, <code>4<sup>3</sup> = 64</code>,
<code>4<sup>4</sup> = 256</code>, <code>4<sup>5</sup> = 1024</code><br>
<code>5<sup>2</sup> = 25</code>, <code>5<sup>3</sup> = 125</code>,
<code>5<sup>4</sup> = 625</code>, <code>5<sup>5</sup> = 3125</code>
</p>

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get
the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

<p align="center">
<code>4</code>, <code>8</code>, <code>9</code>, <code>16</code>, <code>25</code>,
<code>27</code>, <code>32</code>, <code>64</code>, <code>81</code>, <code>125</code>,
<code>243</code>, <code>256</code>, <code>625</code>, <code>1024</code>,
<code>3125</code>
</p>

<p>
How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by <code>a<sup>b</sup></code> for
<code>2 <= a <= 100</code> and <code>2 <= b <= 100</code>?
</p>

### 30 - Digit fifth powers
Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

<p align="center">
<code>1634 = 1<sup>4</sup> + 6<sup>4</sup> + 3<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup></code><br>
<code>8208 = 8<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 0<sup>4</sup> + 8<sup>4</sup></code><br>
<code>9474 = 9<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup> + 7<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup></code>
</p>

<p>
As <code>1 = 1<sup>4</sup></code> is not a sum it is not included.
</p>

The sum of these numbers is `1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316`.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

### 31 - Coin sums
In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are
eight coins in general circulation:

<p align="center">
<code>1p</code>, <code>2p</code>, <code>5p</code>, <code>10p</code>, <code>20p</code>,
<code>50p</code>, <code>£1 (100p)</code>, and <code>£2 (200p)</code>.
</p>

It is possible to make `£2` in the following way:

<p align="center">
<code>1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p</code>
</p>

How many different ways can `£2` be made using any number of coins?

### 32 - Pandigital products
We shall say that an `n`-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits
`1` to `n` exactly once; for example, the `5`-digit number, `15234`, is `1` through `5`
pandigital.\
\
The product `7254` is unusual, as the identity, `39 × 186 = 7254`, containing
multiplicand, multiplier, and product is `1` through `9` pandigital.\
\
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be
written as a `1` through `9` pandigital.\
**HINT**: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include
it once in your sum.

### 33 - Digit cancelling fractions
The fraction `49/98` is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in
attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that `49/98 = 4/8`, which is correct,
is obtained by cancelling the 9s.\
\
We shall consider fractions like, `30/50` = 3/5, to be trivial examples.\
\
There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in
value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.\
\
If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find
the value of the denominator.

### 34 - Digit factorials
`145` is a curious number, as `1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145`.\
\
Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.\
\
**Note:** As `1! = 1` and `2! = 2` are not sums they are not included.

### 35 - Circular primes
The number, `197`, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits:
`197`, `971`, and `719`, are themselves prime.\
\
There are thirteen such primes below `100`: `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11`, `13`, `17`, `31`,
`37`, `71`, `73`, `79`, and `97`.\
\
How many circular primes are there below one million?

### 36 - Double-base palindromes
<p>
The decimal number, <code>585 = 1001001001<sub>2</sub></code> (binary), is palindromic
in both bases.
</p>

Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base `10`
and base `2`.\
\
(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)

### 37 - Truncatable primes
The number `3797` has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible
to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage:
`3797`, `797`, `97`, and `7`. Similarly we can work from right to left:
`3797`, `379`, `37`, and `3`.\
\
Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right
and right to left.\
\
**NOTE:** `2`, `3`, `5`, and `7` are not considered to be truncatable primes.

### 38 - Pandigital multiples
Take the number `192` and multiply it by each of `1`, `2`, and `3`:

<p align="center">
<code>192 × 1 = 192</code><br>
<code>192 × 2 = 384</code><br>
<code>192 × 3 = 576</code>
</p>

By concatenating each product we get the `1` to `9` pandigital, `192384576`. We will
call `192384576` the concatenated product of `192` and `(1,2,3)`.\
\
The same can be achieved by starting with `9` and multiplying by `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`,
and `5`, giving the pandigital, `918273645`, which is the concatenated product of `9`
and `(1,2,3,4,5)`.

What is the largest `1` to `9` pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as
the concatenated product of an integer with `(1,2, ... , n)` where `n > 1`?

### 39 - Integer right triangles
If `p` is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
`{a,b,c}`, there are exactly three solutions for `p = 120`.

<p align="center">
<code>{20,48,52}</code>, <code>{24,45,51}</code>, <code>{30,40,50}</code>
</p>

For which value of `p ≤ 1000`, is the number of solutions maximised?
